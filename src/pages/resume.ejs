                        <p>I was involved in different roles and departments during my career at meltmedia. I began working as a front-end dev with the company's largest client in the bio-pharma space using <strong>Adobe Experience Manager</strong>. I grew into a Senior role and was part of melt's "Custom" department, developing custom client applications in a variety of tech stacks: <strong>Drupal, React, Vue, serverless</strong>...the list goes on. In August 2020 I was asked to assume technical and personnel management of a new multi-million dollar work stream back where I started in the bio-pharma space. I hired and trained a team of developers, worked closely with the client stakeholders, and delivered a smooth launch. Eventually I hired and onboarded the team's permanent manager. When I left the team was thriving!</p>
