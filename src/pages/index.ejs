<h1>Hi, I'm Andy.</h1>
<div class="home-about">
    <div class="left">
        <p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I'm an engineer at <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/">PlayStation</a>, and I have been developing on the client-side, professionally, since 2014. Prior to that I worked in education and the games industry. <br /><br />While I'm not at work you'll find me engaged in one of my (too) many hobbies.</p>
