            <span class="dropcap">O</span>ctober 2021 I participated in Inktober for the third year in a row. That year I thought it would be fun to make monster designs riffing on Pokemon using the daily prompts. I did a little digging and discovered that making fake pokemon was a <em>big</em> thing, and that there's a name for them: fakemon. I wound up designing 16 little monsters that year, and had a lot of fun doing it! I even wrote up fake entries for them as if they were in a Pokedex.
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't have much experience doing 'monster designs' or making cutesy-esque illustrations, so the exercise was challenging in a new way. Part of the process was looking at some of the original 151 pokemon for reference. During my research I learned about the gameboy sprites; specifically this wiki page <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_color_palette_in_Generation_I" target="_blank">showcasing the different color palettes</a> used captured my interest. While I didn't complete 31 illustrations for Inktober that year, I started figuring out how to turn the ones I had completed into sprites.

<h2>Specs</h2>
<p>While the original pokemon Red & Blue versions were rendered in grayscale on the Game Boy DMG and Game Boy Pocket, they had color palettes when played on the Game Boy Color and...the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Game_Boy" target="_blank">Super Game Boy</a>. I had never even heard of the Super Game Boy until doing this research. For my project, I tried to remain as faithful to these renditions as possible, which resulted in the following constraints:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each sprite would have a 56x56 pixel canvas.</li>
    <li>There are 10 palettes to choose from, each containing 4 colors</li>
    <li>Each sprite could only use one palette; no mixing and matching</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

        <p>I completed a few in 2021 and picked the project back up in 2022 to complete the following "original" fakemon pixel pieces. Not all of the illustrations made the cut, but I was pretty happy with how they turned out overall. There were definitely challenges I had to overcome, as certain design elements just wouldn't translate directly to the pixel-art medium without causing visual confusion, etc. Some elements needed to be changed or simplified, like the tiny legs on Ticktock.</p>
        <p>The ultra-restrictive color palette gave me an appreciation for just how talented the artists were when making the Pokemon sprites. The use of dithering to provide a 'fifth' color was a necessary skill I had to develop, too. Thankfully, Aseprite offers some basic dithering tools that does the job for you, which made the whole problem more approachable.</p>

<h2>2023: The Sequel</h2>

<p>Designing legible silhouttes at 56px and with only four colors can be really tough. I only casually participated in Inktober '23 by drawing a few monsters up and immediately rendering them in pixel art. This time around, though, instead of trying to match the cute Pokemon aesthetic I focused instead on more complex forms. I wanted to try and push myself and develop my pixel-art skills further. I kept to the same constraints as the previous years.</p>

<p>Each entry represented some kind of boundary-pushing: the first (Skulk) was a simple idea, but a more complicated form. The second (Janumask) was both a fully fleshed-out narrative concept <em>and</em> a complex form to render. Nightmare, the third and last, was simpler in all aspects, but was the most challenging due to color decisions. I wanted black to be the primary color, and up to this point black had mostly been used for borders and elements appearing 'behind' the forms spatially.</p>

<p>I very much enjoy working on these pixel-fakemon, and expect to do another round of them again in October '24.</p>
