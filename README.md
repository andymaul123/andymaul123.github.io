# andymaul123.github.io
GitHub Pages Website
Built using [Nanogen SSG](https://doug2k1.github.io/nanogen/docs/).

View the live site at [www.andrewmaul.com](https://www.andrewmaul.com/).

## Development
- `npm install`
- `npm run start` to start the local server at port 3000
- `npm run css` to compile SASS
- `npm run build` to compile the site into the `/public` directory
- `npm run new-post` to initialize a wizard that scaffolds the creating of a new post.

After changes are made, pushing to `main` in Github will trigger the Github Pages workflow. Nothing else needed!
